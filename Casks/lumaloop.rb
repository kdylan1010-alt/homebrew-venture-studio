  caveats <<~EOS
    LumaLoop is ad-hoc signed and not notarised by Apple, so macOS will block it
    the first time. To open it: right-click the app in Finder, choose Open, then
    confirm. You only need to do this once.

    It is built end-to-end by an autonomous agent pipeline. Source and build
